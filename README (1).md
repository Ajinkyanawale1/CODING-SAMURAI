# HR Analytics Project

### Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing employee data to identify trends in attrition, performance, and satisfaction, providing insights that can help HR departments make data-driven decisions. The goal is to understand the factors that drive employee behavior and propose strategies for improving retention and performance.

### Key Objectives:
1. **Attrition Analysis**: Identify key factors that contribute to employee attrition.
2. **Performance Assessment**: Evaluate performance across different departments and roles.
3. **Satisfaction Analysis**: Understand how satisfaction levels affect overall performance and employee retention.
4. **Predictive Modeling**: Use machine learning to predict the likelihood of employee attrition.

### Dataset

The dataset contains a variety of employee-related features, such as:
- **Employee ID**: Unique identifier for each employee
- **Age**: Employee's age
- **Department**: The department in which the employee works
- **Education**: Employee's education level
- **Job Role**: Employee's role within the organization
- **Performance Rating**: Score reflecting the employee's performance
- **Attrition**: Whether the employee has left the organization
- **Satisfaction Level**: Score indicating the employee’s satisfaction
- **Monthly Income**: Employee’s monthly salary
- **Years at Company**: Duration of employment

### Key Analysis & Visualizations

1. **Attrition Breakdown**:
   - Analysis of attrition rates across departments and job roles.
   - Visualization: Bar charts and pie charts displaying the proportion of employees who have left the company.

2. **Performance Evaluation**:
   - Compare employee performance across various departments.
   - Visualization: Box plots and bar charts showing the distribution of performance ratings by department.

3. **Satisfaction Analysis**:
   - Assess satisfaction levels and their impact on performance and attrition.
   - Visualization: Histograms and scatter plots exploring the relationship between satisfaction scores and attrition.

4. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, random forest) to predict employee attrition.
   - Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
